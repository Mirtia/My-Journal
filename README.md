# My Journal (Digital Garden)


This is the start of blogging out my notes. I began with some Reversing and I'm going to continue with AI and some other interesting topics. I do that to revise what I learn and also markdown syntax is satisfying.

To clone:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Mirtia/mirtia.github.io.git
```

## Quartz v4

> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.
